            <h6>Our Story</h6>
            <p>As Barb remembers, 'It was all a dream, I used to read Beer Brew magazine. Barley, hops, and malt up in the limousine.'  
                Those were the days before she closed the doors on her old life and opened the doors of her brewery.
                On that opening day, August 7th, 1995, a star was born. Yes, we went there. Her first brew, The Barb, was  
                 a meaty trip for the senses. And with that, Barb gave the world the greatest gift of all: 
                The gift of great beer. From there, minds and waistlines grew, history was made, and she has never looked back.
                </p>

            <h6>Our Facility</h6>
            <p>Before our shovels hit the earth, we stood upon a mere wasteland of mystery juices, aboandoned VCRs, and computer parts. 
                We came, we saw, we covered all that up with a little dirt â€” you could say we conquered. The result: Barb's farm; a place 
                with acres and acres of things that turn water into beer. While Jesus was more of a wine guy, we think he'd be proud. 
                Especially becuase it's always a party down here. Come on down and visit us anytime!
